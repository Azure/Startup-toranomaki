# How do I avoid unexpected Azure charges?

To avoid unexpected charges on Azure:

- Set up budgets and cost alerts in the Azure Portal (Cost Management + Billing > Budgets).
- Regularly review your resource usage and delete unused resources.
- Use the Azure Pricing Calculator before deploying new services.
- Enable spending caps if available (for free/trial accounts).
- Review invoices and cost analysis reports monthly.

**Tip:**
- Use resource tags to track project or team spending.
